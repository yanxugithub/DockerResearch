When Oracle linux 8.4 docker image is used. VS 2019 remote debug does not work.
The reason is that remote debug is not working is that .net sdk(that has the remote debugger) is required.

The following is the docker file that install .net sdk atop oracle linux 8.4 image so that
vs 2019 remote debug .net 5 app in the linux container would work seamlessly. The key is to add
RUN /bin/bash -c 'dnf install dotnet-sdk-5.0 -y' right after the first FROM serving as the basis.
-y command ensures donet-sdk-5.0 if already installed may be skipped. This docker file is re-runnable.
